Power Grid Simulation System
============================

Author: Mohamed Saleh    
Project: Power Grid Simulation  
Language: C++

Description:
------------
This project simulates an advanced energy distribution system where electricity is generated by various plant types and delivered to demand locations via high-capacity transmission lines. The simulation models real-world constraints like plant uptime, sustainability, efficiency losses, and cost tracking to optimize power delivery.

Key Features:
-------------
- Models eight plant types including Solar, Wind, Hydro, Fossil, Nuclear, Geothermal, Fusion, and Di-Lithium.
- Power plants are stored in a custom-linked list, sorted dynamically by sustainability score.
- Transmission lines are read from a binary file and sorted by efficiency using STL sorting.
- Demand locations are allocated power through a multi-factor optimization algorithm considering plant capacity and line efficiency.
- Outputs include:
  * Real-time allocation logs
  * Initial and final grid status summaries
  * A full simulation report (demand met, plant usage, revenue, profit, efficiency)

Technical Highlights:
---------------------
- Object-oriented architecture with polymorphic plant subclasses.
- Custom templated linked list with iterator support.
- Binary file parsing with `seekg()` and `read()` for structured data access.
- Memory management using virtual destructors and cleanup routines.
- Simulation comparison before and after optimization.
